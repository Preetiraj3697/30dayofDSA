// Category of String Ended
// Description

// You are given a string, whose length is stored in a variable with the nameN

// The string is stored in a variable with the namestr

// The string only contains small case characters, and each character, is given a category such thata = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4, ......, z = 26

// You have to generate a new string, such that each character, is replaced by the value of its category

// For example, consider the value stored instr = abcd, andN = 4

// Now, replacing each character with it's category, we get1234, as the new string, which is the required answer


// Input
// The first line of the input contains the value stored inN

// The next line contains the value stored instr


// Output
// Print the new modified string, as explained in the problem statement

// Sample Input 1 

// 4
// abcd
// Sample Output 1

// 1234
// Hint

// In the sample test case, the value stored instr = abcd, andN = 4

// Now, replacing each character with it's category, we get1234, as the new string, which is the required answer

//Code
