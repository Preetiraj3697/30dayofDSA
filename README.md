DATA STRUCTURE QUESTIONS

``1. What are Data Structures?``
   
   A data structure is a mechanical or logical way that data is organized within a program. The organization of data is what determines how a program performs. There are many types of data structures, each with its own uses. When designing code, we need to pay particular attention to the way data is structured. If data isn't stored efficiently or correctly structured, then the overall performance of the code will be reduced.

``2. Why Create Data Structures?``

Data structures serve a number of important functions in a program. They ensure that each line of code performs its function correctly and efficiently, they help the programmer identify and fix problems with his/her code, and they help to create a clear and organized code base.

``3. What are some applications of Data structures?``

Following are some real-time applications of data structures:
   - Decision Making
   - Genetics
   - Image Processing
   - Blockchain
   - Numerical and Statistical Analysis
   - Compiler Design
   - Database Design and many more
